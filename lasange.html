<h1>Lasagna !! One of the most loved foods in the world is finally here! This is a traditional Italian Lasagna, made the Italian way with layers of slow cooked Bolognese ragu and cheese sauce. No ricotta – that’s the American-Italian version. </h1>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
   <li>The meat sauce;</li>
   <li>The white sauce – creamy and thick, but no cream required!</li>
   <li>Assembling and baking.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
  <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
  <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
  <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
